There are two packages to install (where XXX represents the lib suffix for the 
  version you are installing):
  * dklangXXX.dpk - runtime package 
  * dcldklangXXX.dpk - design time package
  
The runtime package contains the code necessary for your application.
The design package installs the language controller component, and some 
  utilities into the IDE.
    
==============================================================================
Installing the packages
==============================================================================

The packages need to be installed in the correct order because the design time 
  package depends on the runtime package. The runtime package is the only one 
  that needs to be built multiple times to support multiple platforms. The 
  design time package only needs to be built for the IDE platform (win32).
  
  * load dklangXXX.dpk and dcldklangXXX.dpk into the IDE
  * build the runtime package dklangXXX.dpk
  * build and install the design time package dcldklangXXX.dpk:

==============================================================================
Setting library paths
==============================================================================
Your code will need to be able to find dklang.pas. This can be done by
  adding library paths to the IDE.
  
To add a library path to dklang.pas for each platform:
  under Tools|Options :
    Environment Options|Delphi Options|Library
    for each platform:
      change "Selected Platform" to the platform
      add the path to dklang.pas to "Library path"
